<p>The following are corrections for typographical errors in Building and Extending Gaim</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Chapter 1, Page 13</strong> (<em>Thanks to Chris Kapusta for noticing this</em>) The CVS command for logging into Gaim's CVS repository anonymously is missing a character. It should read <code>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gaim login</code></li>

<li><strong>Chapter 8, Page 278</strong> (<em>Thanks to Ike Gingerich for noticing this</em>) The final code example on this page contains an additional backslash on the first line. It should read <code>for (i = str; *i != '\0'; i++) {</code> like the two examples before it</li>

</ul>
